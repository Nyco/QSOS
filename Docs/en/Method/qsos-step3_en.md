# Step 3Â : Qualify

![Position in the process](../Images/qualify-en.png)

## Purpose

The purpose of this step is to define a set of elements translating the needs and constraints lined to the selection approach of a piece of open source software. The context in which the software will be used has to be set, in order to get a filter used in the Selection step.

## Filters

### Identity filter

The first level of filtering can be set on the data relative to the software identity. It can be, for example, to consider only the software of a certain type, or only distributed under a specific license.

### Maturity filter

Filter on the maturity of the project

The degree of relevance of every maturity criterion is set depending on the context :

* not relevant criterion, not to be included in the filter ;

* relevant criterion ;

* critical criterion.

This degree of relevance will be translated into a weighting value in the next step of the process, depending on the chosen selection mode.

### Functional coverage filter

Every functionality described in the evaluation template is assigned a level of requirement, in the following list:

* required functionality ;

* optional functionality ;

* not required functionality.

These requirements will be associated to weighting values during the Select step, depending on the chosen selection mode.
